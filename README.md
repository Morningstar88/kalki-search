## [Latest developments](https://github.com/Morningstar88/kalki-search/issues) [Latest developments](https://github.com/Morningstar88/kalki-search/issues)Kalki is a prototype search engine that uses the Bing API. We're inspired by [Ecosia](www.ecosia.org). Ecosia give 80% of their profits to tree planting in Burkina Faso. [They've planted over 24 million trees](https://info.ecosia.org/).

We plan to register as a charity in Taiwan. This costs about 1500USD.

Kalki will show users weather, and interesting innovative projects from the local area. We'll show solar + wind power, water filtration, hydroponics, aeroponics. Any interesting local project or charity is cool. We want to represent the charities and bright innovators who are not shown on the news.

Google [dominates 70% of the search market](https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/), but they are losing market share. Ecosia have found themselves 7 million customers, and proven the concept of charity search.

## Roadmap, Spring 2018
- **Fix colors:** Search colors need to be different from google, with dark greens, but currently they are not easily readable. 
- **Fix media queries:** Kalki does not look good on all phones right now.
- **Fix image search:** Image search returns pics that are too small. [Ecosia's image serch looks good](https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=image+search). We want to build something similar. 
- **App:** Make a simple android or iOS app..
- **Serve song lyrics.** Our first JS adventure will be an experiment to see if we can serve lyrics to users in the same way that Google does. 

We welcome contributions from front end programmers, beginners or advanced. Feel free to send a pull request.

The name [Kalki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalki) comes from the mythical Hindu warrior...
