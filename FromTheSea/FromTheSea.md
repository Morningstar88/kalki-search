## From The Sea. Factsheet of Civilization Basics.

Here’s your final, all-in-one cheat sheet for Koh Rong:

**Vinegar Making**: Ferment **500mL tamarind/dragon fruit juice** with acetic acid bacteria. Warm, oxygen-rich area (**25°C–30°C**). Ensure **5–8% alcohol content**; convert to acetic acid in **2 weeks**. Filter, sterilize for storage. Yield: **80–90% usable vinegar**. **Cleanliness essential**.

**Yeast Propagation**: Mix **1L water, 15g sugar** in sterilized jar. Add **5g yeast** (dry/starter). Cover loosely for aeration. Feed every **3 days** to maintain growth. Visible bubbles by day **2–3**. Avoid contamination. Propagation success rate **95%**.

**Sourdough From Zero**: Combine **250g flour, 250mL water** in jar. Stir daily, feed same ratio. Loose covering for aeration, bubbling visible **day 5**. Maintain starter acidity **4.5–5 pH**. Use or refrigerate promptly. Homemade bread requires **patience, precision**.

**Aluminum, Beer Cans, Alzheimer’s**: No proven aluminum-Alzheimer's causation, studies inconclusive. Beer cans leach **1–5 mg/L aluminum** in acidic drinks. Steel/glass preferred. Limit lifetime exposure. **2.3% global health risks** linked to heavy metals like aluminum.

**Hammock Simple Making**: Use **2m fabric**, fold/sew edges for strength. Add loops. Rope knots: prusik holds **150kg tension**. Anchor trees ideally **3–5m apart**. Lightweight but sturdy design ensures safety and durability.

**Farming Near Sea**: Build **25–50cm raised beds**, add **10–15cm compost** to block salt seepage. Filter seawater; dilute for irrigation. Apply **2% H₂O₂** for root oxygenation. Salt-tolerant crops like barley survive **85%+** with preparation.

**Yard Beans**: Sow **3cm deep** in loamy soil, space seeds **30cm apart**. Provide trellis support for **2–3m vines**. Sun, water crucial. Nitrogen fixer improves soil. Spray **2% iodine solution** for fungal resistance. Harvest in **50–60 days**.

**Kangkung/Morning Glory**: Sow seeds **2cm deep** or plant cuttings in **moist, enriched soil**. Thrives in brackish water or wetlands. Visible growth **7 days**, harvest in **30–45 days**. **2% H₂O₂** boosts oxygenation in hydroponics setups.

**Seawater Agriculture**: Farming in saline environments using salt-tolerant crops (halophytes). Methods: raised beds, fresh/seawater mix, biofilters, desalination. Improves degraded land, resource efficiency. Popular crops: quinoa, mangroves, salicornia. Thrives in arid coastal regions with proper management.

**Semi-Desalinate Water (Showering/Washing)**: Boil seawater; collect condensed vapor or use solar distiller. Blend with fresh water **1:3 ratio**. For washing: **1mL iodine** or **3% H₂O₂ per liter** for disinfection. Basic filtration reduces sediments.

**Liquid Soap (Coconut Oil, Lye)**: Mix **200g coconut oil, 60g potassium hydroxide (lye)**, **150mL water**. Heat gently, stir until emulsified. Dilute soap paste with water (desired thickness). Add lemon juice or **3% H₂O₂** for extra cleansing.

**Water Purification**: Boil water for **10 minutes**, cool, add **4 drops iodine per liter** or use **3% H₂O₂ (10mL per liter)** for microbial safety. Sand-charcoal layers filter sediments. Always sterilize storage containers.

**Solar Still Construction**: Use a clear plastic sheet, a bowl, and weights. Seal edges; collect condensed fresh water from evaporated seawater. Yield: **500mL daily** per square meter. Simple, effective for survival scenarios.

**Charcoal Making**: Use dried wood, burn in oxygen-limited setup (barrel/pit). Maintain **450–600°C** for hours. Cool, crush for cooking fuel or water filtration. Efficient yield: **20–30% weight in charcoal**.

**Fishing Net Repair**: Use nylon thread or fishing line. Simple knot techniques: clove hitch for strong anchoring. Replace torn sections with **50kg-test strength material**. Net repairs enhance durability and reduce waste.

**Natural Insect Repellent**: Mix **50mL coconut oil**, **10 drops citronella essential oil**, and **5mL H₂O₂**. Apply sparingly on skin. Works for **6–8 hours**, eco-friendly solution to keep bugs at bay.

**Liquid Soap (Coconut Oil, Lye)**: Mix 200g coconut oil, 60g potassium hydroxide (lye), and 150mL water. Heat gently, stir until paste forms. Dilute soap paste to desired consistency. Add optional scents or 3% H₂O₂ for extra cleansing. Safety: Use gloves.

**Lye Making:** Use hardwood ash, rainwater. Layer ash in a barrel, drip rainwater slowly through. Collect runoff; ensure lye concentration floats an egg (ideal density 1.2 g/cm³). Evaporate excess liquid for stronger lye. Handle carefully; highly caustic.
