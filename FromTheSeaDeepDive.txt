## LOW-GRID COMPUTER

### Slow Net Git Uploads
1. **Local Development & Batch Updates**: Develop locally and commit changes incrementally. Push them all at once during a stable connection window. Saves time compared to frequent small uploads.
2. **SSH for Precision**: Use `git push` over SSH—direct and lightweight. Compress before pushing with `git gc` (garbage collection) or `git push --thin` to reduce data transfer by skipping redundant data.
3. **Sparse-Checkout or Shallow Clone**: When pulling large repos, use `git clone --depth=1` for shallow cloning. Avoid fetching unnecessary branches or commits.
4. **GUI Tools**: Tools like Sourcetree can help stage commits graphically, or GitHub’s browser interface for selective file uploads in small chunks if needed.

### Disabling JavaScript for Speed
1. **In Browsers**: Disabling JavaScript reduces load times. Most browsers have developer tools (e.g., in Chrome: `Settings > Privacy > Site Settings > JavaScript > Block`). Just note: many sites lose functionality.
2. **Text-Only Browsers**: Consider minimalistic browsers like Lynx or w3m. These are text-only, fast, and great for a simpler web experience.
3. **Extensions/Add-Ons**: Tools like uBlock Origin can block scripts selectively, speeding up browsing for key tasks.

### Text-Only Knowledge Library
1. **Format**: Use simple `.txt` or `.md` files for maximum compatibility and fast rendering. Categorize by tags or folders.
2. **Distribution**: Host on GitHub or serve through a static site generator (e.g., Hugo). These are low-resource solutions, accessible even on slow connections.
3. **Offline Access**: Use tools like wget to pull resources locally, ensuring access without the net.
4. **Content Ideas**: Add practical survival guides, historical texts, DIY hacks, scientific overviews—whatever speaks to timeless, self-sufficient knowledge.
